      This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten
      way of cooking butter rice. It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in,
      it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, with
      seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>
      Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As
      soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown
      sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.
    </p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>
      Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water,
      and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently
      shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then reduce
      heat to medium-low.
    </p>
    <p>Step 3</p>
    <p>
      Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest,
      covered, for 10 minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.
    </p>
    <p>Step 4</p>
    <p>
      Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains.
      Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green
      onions.
